# Bundesliga Web Scraping

This script performs web scraping on the Bundesliga website to extract the league table data.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- requests
- BeautifulSoup

You can install them using pip:

```shell
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Run the script:

```shell
python bundesliga_scraping.py
```

The script will fetch the Bundesliga table data from the official website, extract the required information, and save it to a CSV file.

## Configuration

The script uses headers to emulate a browser behavior during the HTTP request. The headers can be found in the `headers` dictionary in the code. Feel free to modify the headers if needed.

## Output

The script saves the extracted data to a CSV file named `bundesliga_table.csv`. The file is located in the `csv` directory. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.
